Title: How to use audacity and some common techniques for it
Author: Jason Evans 
The purpose of this is to explain some of the features of audacity and how to use them to create multi-level audio tracks. I will be showing some of the 
more techincal aspects of audacity as well. The content of the tutorial is a publisher document with instructions.
This is intended for anyone who wants to use audacity, be it someone who is simply using it to edit a sound out or someone who is making a song. It is not intended
for a specific age group but someone using audacity should not need to have much experience with editing.
